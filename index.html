        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>My name is Phillip Negrete. I was born and raised in Hawthorne, California and I currently live in Riverside, California because I am a second year student at the University of California-Riverside. The major I am pursuing my degree for is Biology. I am studying Biology because in the future, I would like to become a Physical Therapist. It is my goal to become a Physical Therapist because it combines my top interests, sports and anatomy. Growing up, I had always been an active person. I played soccer from age 6 up until my freshman year of high school, I ran cross country for the next two years, and I played for the baseball team at my highschool for my senior year. Now that I donâ€™t really have the chance to play sports in college, I frequent the gym a lot more thanks to the available resources near my campus apartment. Sports, exercise, and physical activity have always been an important part of my life but I did not quite have the passion to pursue becoming a professional athlete because I am also interested in anatomy. This interest was first sparked in my senior year of high school and I was not even aware that I had it. Learning about anatomy was the best part of my day and the subject captivated me so much that it led me to pursue this career. 
<br>
<br>
       Iâ€™ve spent about 30 hours so far just shadowing physical therapists, but I have no other experience with the field other than that. I do, however, have experience in the workfield. I needed to get a job in order to support myself financially while Iâ€™m attending school so for the past two years that I have been here in Riverside, I have worked at Stacked Bicycle Shop, Subway, and Vans. Each workplace I have attended has offered me its own unique learning experience. While working at Stacked Bicycle Shop, I learned more personable skills and grew out of my shell because at bike shops, youâ€™re supposed to make the customers feel more at home and the BMX/bike community is supposed to feel welcoming to all. While working at Subway I learned how to successfully do my work in the most efficient way possible because I was constantly under the stress coming from the big line of customers waiting for their sandwich. While working at Vans, I was able to combine the past two experiences and it led me to become a very friendly and efficient worker. The reason why I bring up these skills from my past work experiences, even though they donâ€™t relate to the study of Physical Therapy, is because I believe being a Physical Therapist is more than just an understanding of anatomy. I believe a good Physical Therapist is one who makes the patient feel welcomed on top of their knowledge of anatomy. No one wants a shy or quiet doctor and I believe my past work experience has allowed me to defy that. I used to be that shy and quiet person but thanks to my work experience, I have grown out of it and I am a much more outgoing person. I believe these skills will allow me to thrive as a great Physical Therapist, even more so when Iâ€™m given the opportunity to learn more about the field.
